%% Connected Topoplot
% This is a demonstration of using the topoplot_connect.m function. This
% function is only slightly modified from the original topoplot.m function
% which is part of EEGLAB. I have used EEGLAB v6.01b while modifying the
% topoplot function into topoplot_connect.
%
% I used the topoplot_connect function while developing a method for 
% isolating transient task-induced  networks in the brain at Cognitive 
% Neuroscience Lab, DUKE-NUS Graduate Medical School. The idea can be
% summarized visually in the below graphic.

%% Usage and inputs
% >> topoplot_connect(ds, EEG.chanlocs);
%
% *ds* is the display strcture with the folowing fields:
%
% * *ds.chanPairs* (required) - N x 2 matrix, with N being the number of 
% connected channel pairs. For example, ds.chanPairs = [7, 12; 13 20]; 
% specifies two connected channel pairs (7, 12) and (13, 20).
% * *ds.connectStrength* (optional) - N x 1 matrix, a vector specifying
% connection strengths. If unspecified, then the connections will be
% rendered in a color at the center of the current colormap.
% * *ds.connectStrengthLimits* (optional) - 1 x 2 matrix specifying minimum
% and maximum values of connection strengths to display. If it is not 
% specified, then the minimum and maximum values from ds.connectStrength 
% are used.
%
% EEG.chanlocs is a structure specifying channel locations (same as in any
% other EEGLAB function - A sample is provided with this script).
%

%% Creating the basic display structure (ds.chanPairs)
% Suppose you have connected channel pairs that you wish to display. I am
% going to create random channel pairs for illustration using an 'adjacency
% matrix' representation of the 'graph' of channel pairs that we wish to
% plot.
%
% Create the adjacency matrix with random connections. Given 28 channels,
% total possible connections are 28C2 = 378. I will randomly connect ~10%
% of the channel pairs.
clear ds;
numChannels = 28;
a = rand(numChannels, numChannels);
adjMat = (a - triu(a)) >= 0.9;

%%
% Gather the adjacency matrix values into a Nx2 matrix, where N is the
% number of connected channel pairs
[ds.chanPairs(:, 1) ds.chanPairs(:, 2)] = ind2sub(size(adjMat), find(adjMat));
ds.chanPairs = [];
%% Specifying the channel locations
% Locations of the EEG channels are determiined by the 'chanlocs' structure
% Once you acquire your EEG dataset and load it into EEGLAB, type 
% chanlocs = EEG.chanlocs; at the command prompt to get the chanlocs
% strcuture. I am going to load a sample from our acquisition setup. Note
% that this may work for most setups with the same number of standard
% channels.

%% Specify connection strength
% Suppose you have a measure of connectivity (such as Phase Locking Value)
% between channel pairs and you wish to color code the connection
% strengths. For illustration, I am just going to use the values in the
% random matrix that was created earlier.
